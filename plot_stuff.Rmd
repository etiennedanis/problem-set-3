## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Including something else

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)
mtcars %>%
  mutate(id = rownames(mtcars)) %>%
  filter(mpg < 20) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg, label=id)) + geom_point() + geom_label_repel()
```
